# Just Road Stuff

Just Road Stuff is a Fork of the Minecraft Mod Road Stuff which adds road blocks and items related to roads.
The purpose of this fork is to remove the cruft from the mod, such as the useless items, achievements, configuration menu, and recipes so that you can have just road stuff for building.

Currently including:
- Asphalt road blocks
- Concrete roads blocks
- 6 different kinds of lines, including corners and some crossings + variants
- Arrows
- Traffic cones (3 variants)
- Traffic Signs 
- English Language support

Planned features:
- None, at the moment.
